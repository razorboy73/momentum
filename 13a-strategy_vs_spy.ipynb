      "  Based on the analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. NOISE REDUCTION: A 5-day confirmation reduces bear segments from 93 to ~20-30,\n",
      "     filtering out the 1-3 day noise around the 200 DMA crossovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. STATISTICAL POWER: The IR estimates become more stable with fewer, longer\n",
      "     segments. However, significance levels may change.\n",
      "\n",
      "  3. TRADE-OFF: Longer confirmation periods:\n",
      "     - PRO: Fewer whipsaw signals, cleaner regime classification\n",
      "     - CON: Delayed regime detection (you're 5+ days late to recognize the shift)\n",
      "     - CON: Fewer bear days to analyze, potentially less statistical power\n",
      "\n",
      "  4. PRACTICAL USE: If you're using this regime signal for trading decisions,\n",
      "     a 5-10 day confirmation is reasonable. If it's just for performance\n",
      "     attribution, 1-day is fine (with the caveat about choppy periods).\n",
