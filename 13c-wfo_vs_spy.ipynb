      "     - Resamples excess returns (strat - spy) directly\n",
      "     - Computes Sharpe of the resampled excess returns\n",
      "     - Each bootstrap sample has the SAME number of observations\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. REGIME-AWARE METHOD:\n",
      "     - Resamples the full series (strat, spy, AND regime labels together)\n",
      "     - Then computes regime-specific stats on each bootstrap sample\n",
      "     - The \"overall\" IR should theoretically match, but...\n",
      "     - Regime proportions can vary between bootstrap samples\n",
      "\n",
      "  The discrepancy likely comes from:\n",
      "  - Random seed handling differences between the two bootstrap loops\n",
      "  - The regime method resamples regime labels too, which can slightly \n",
      "    change the effective weighting\n",
      "  - Numerical precision in how returns are combined\n",
      "\n",

    "     - Each bootstrap sample has the SAME number of observations\n",
    "     \n",
    "  2. REGIME-AWARE METHOD:\n",
    "     - Resamples the full series (strat, spy, AND regime labels together)\n",
    "     - Then computes regime-specific stats on each bootstrap sample\n",
    "     - The \"overall\" IR should theoretically match, but...\n",
    "     - Regime proportions can vary between bootstrap samples\n",
    "     \n",
    "  The discrepancy likely comes from:\n",
    "  - Random seed handling differences between the two bootstrap loops\n",
    "  - The regime method resamples regime labels too, which can slightly \n",
    "    change the effective weighting\n",
    "  - Numerical precision in how returns are combined\n",
